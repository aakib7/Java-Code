Supporting sentences The sentences in the main part of the paragraph support and develop the main idea Each sentence should connect to the others to create a logical flow This is where you incorporate your research and analysis and support it with evidence such as quotations or statistics Whenever you use an idea that is not yours whether quoted or paraphrased you must cite its source Referencing is central to academic integrity which means that you must acknowledge when you have built your argument on the work of other scholars Concluding and linking sentences The final sentence of your paragraph should summarize or conclude the idea that you introduced in the topic sentence It can also lead on to the next paragraph by developing a logical link to the next main idea Good transitions at the end of paragraphs help the essay to feel more coherent If you have trouble linking the main ideas across your paragraphs consider reordering them The conclusion The final section of your essay is where you move the focus outwards from your specific topic to a question about its wider relevance You should first summarize your position and the key points you made throughout your essay This reorients the reader and reminds them of what you have argued No new points should be made in the conclusion It is also best to avoid introducing new sources of evidence The next part of a conclusion considers the implications of your argument Think about what it means for the topic or the wider field It is also possible to include some brief speculation about the implications for the future Ending your essay with a strong and memorable sentence can help to leave the reader satisfied that you have answered the question well recidivism and greater community acceptance
