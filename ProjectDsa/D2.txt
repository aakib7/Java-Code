emergency he or she can step out of the classroom to do so This setup would give the students and the instructor peace of mind
Cell phone restrictions in classrooms should also include specific disciplinary actions for breaking the rules If a student is caught using the phone in class he or she should be excused for the rest of the day Professors should refrain from physically taking possession of a student phone because of liability conflicts If the phone is damaged while in the professor possession the school or the instructor could be held responsible for the repairs It is safer to ask the student to leave the classroom than it is to take the phone away completely
Each school professor and student body is different Colleges must adapt their rules and discipline efforts to reflect the current needs of their students Eliminating cell phones in college classrooms is an overstretch but there are ways to balance student rights and instructors rights With the right amount of control and flexibility colleges can create a pleasant learning environment with maximum safety and minimal interruptions Now you have written your thesis statement and have carried out preliminary research the next step is to formulate an essay structure that is logical coherent and maximally persuasive The argument you make determines your structure The key reasons for your position form the main points that are developed in your essay If you change your argument you will likely need to change your essay structure in order to better support the new argument At this stage write down the basic structure as a list Think of each line as a new heading or section of your essay Arrange these main points in a way that you think is most logical and where the ideas flow together well Do not be afraid to experiment with alternative structures as this process may lead you to refine your argument further
