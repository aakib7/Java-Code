that you have read and understood the required texts 2 You need to come to your own conclusions You need to show that you have understood the material and come to your own conclusions on the basis of what you have read and heard Copying from textbooks or pasting text from the Internet into your own writing is not good enough Most of what you write will come from the ideas of other people from the textbooks you read the lectures and the seminars you attend and your discussions with other students etc This is what academic study is all about However the purpose of an assignment is for you to say something for yourself using the ideas that you have studied so you can present ideas you have learned in your own way The emphasis should be on working with other people ideas not simply reproducing their words 3 It is against the regulations You must not use another person words or ideas as if they were your own This is against university regulations and is considered a very serious offence If you plagiarize your lecturer cannot understand how well you understand the course and cannot therefore give you useful advice and support In addition if you plagiarize you are not learning This will become obvious in any written examination you are required to take You need to acknowledge the source of an idea unless it is common knowledge It may be difficult to decide exactly what is common knowledge within your subject but if your lecturer in lectures or handouts or your textbooks do not acknowledge the source then you can assume that it is common knowledge within your subject For ideas which are generally accepted as valid within your specialism there is no need to provide a reference
